# Microfrontends with Webpack 5 Module Federation

## Microfrontends
Martin Fowler defined the Micro-Frontend architecture as "an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole". Simply, a Micro-Frontend is a portion of a webpage (not the entire page). In the Micro-Frontend Architecture, there is a "Host" or a "Container"page that can host one or more Micro-Frontends. The Host/Container page can also share some of its own Micro-Frontend components.

## Webpack
webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

## Module Federation

## Main Concepts

module:

    The smallest unit of shareable code. Can be a single file.

bi-directional host:

    A webpack build that is both a host consuming remotes and a remote being consumed by other hosts.
